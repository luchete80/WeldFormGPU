20220511 - Working on Contact Neighbuors. Written for constant offset (fized size 20). 
20220517 - Working on Contact Neighbours. Done! Now working OK with contact surface.
            Begingin to work with contact forces. 
20220531 - Creating CUDA device mesh for contact, since forces refer to mesh elements. 
20220603 - Working with contact. Parallelizing mesh creation and update. 
20220608 - Added Mesh move command. 
20220610 - Added TensorRate function 
20220613 - Working with kickdrift solver. Added RateTensor calculation.
20220615 - Working on kickdrift solver. Fixed some error in stresses calc.
20220621 - Added internal energy eqn (#95)
---------------------------------------------------------
20220908 - Begining to add Nishimura reduction to work with pairs
20220919 - Working on Contact, founded that velocity is not updated. 
20221004 - Corrected some memory allocation bugs in contact.
           Changed to Wang contact.
           Found error in normal calculation.
20221018 - Closed issues #98 and #99, normals and mesh update.
20221024 - Cleaning some comments. Finally mesh is moving, but MEchSolve does not work with such big CFL.
           Added not write ID for contact surface
20221025 - Detected  wrong time step in contact problem
           Added contact forces in leapfrog solver (THE ONLY ONE WHICH WORKS UP UNTIL NOW)
           Contact problema Working normally without contact mesh. 
           PROBLEM WAS IN NOT SETTING Particles[i]->Cs
20221028 - Contact is still with problems. 
           Added GeneralAfter and UserAcc function to apply BC 
--------------------------------------------------------------
20221104 - ERROR found in interaction with contact problems. 
           There was an exception in contact_surf_id but it was only for j particle! 
           Solid part count was wrongly set. Remove from set dimension.
20221114 - Error copying particle v, a, and x to host. BUT rarely, this change
           CONTACT STILL WITH ERROR, DISPLACEMENTS ARE WRONG(ASSYMETRIC TO THE SIDE)
           ADDING FRICTION
20221115 - Fixed bug in fraser solver with user defined bc
           Corrected BUG in Fraser Contact Solver. There was no updated rigid particles. 
20221122 - Write normals to output
           Added Normals to Solver Fraser
