/** \typedef particleinfo
 * 	\brief Particle informations (type, flags, ....)
 *
 * 	Particle related informations such as particle type, flags, id, .... are stored
 * 	in an ushort4 with:
 *		- .x: particle type and flags
 *		- .y: object id and fluid number
 *		- (.z << 16) + .w: global particle id
 *
 *	The particle type is a short integer organized this way:
 * 		- lowest 3 bits: particle type
 * 		- next 13 bits: flags
 *	Particle types are mutually exclusive (e.g. a particle is _either_
 * 	boundary _or_ vertex, but not both)
 *
 *	The maximum number of particle types we can have with 4 is
 *	2^3 = 8 of which 4 are actually used.
 *
 *	The global particle id, is the id assigned to the particle in the problem
 *	copy_to_array method. Considering that the last two fields are unlikely to be
 *	used for actual computations, we use it to store the global particle id. This
 *  allow us to track 2^32 (about 4 billion) particles.
 * 	In the extremely unlikely case that we need more, we can consider the
 *	particle id object-local and use (((.y << 16) + .z) << 16) + .w as a
 * 	_global_ particle id. This would allow us to uniquely identify up to
 * 	2^48 (about 281 trillion) particles.
 *
 * \todo consider making it its own structure

/** \typedef vertexinfo
 * 	\brief Connectivity between boundary particles and vertices for SA
 *
 * 	SA boundary requires connectivity information for the boundary elements:
 * 	we need to know the vertices indices for each boundary element.
 * 	This information is stored in a uint4 with:
 *		- .x: id of vertex number 0
 *		- .y: id of vertex number 1
 *		- .z: id of vertex number 2
 *		- .w: unused
 *
 *	\note the ordering of vertices is not random, when filling the connectivity
 *	table we need to use, without any modification, the data from Crixus
 *
 *	\note uint4 was used instead of uint3 for enforcing coalescing
